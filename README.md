# buy_in_pay_out

A new Flutter project. Bet with friends with the least number of payouts. Not necessary to pay the pot upfront.

## Additional Info
This is my first Flutter project. Still learning. Lots of clean up to do, don't judge me yet. 

This project was developed as a way for friends to bet with chips and later pay out online in the least number of transactions. Players can cash out before others in case someone leaves mid-game.
